# Introduction To Go for Front End Developers

Prepared for Front End Masters
September, 2019

## How To Use This Repo

The master branch of this repo is a starting point that is meant to go along
with a series of slides.

This README will be updated as the slide presentation is solidified, linking
particular slides and exercises to files discussed during the presentation.

Final versions of all exercises and examples will be pushed up to their own
branches.

## Setup

To take full advantage of the examples and exercises in this repo, make sure to
[download and install Go](golang.org/dl).
